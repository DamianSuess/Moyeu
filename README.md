# Moyeu

Moyeu is an Android application built with [Xamarin.Android](http://xamarin.com/monoforandroid) to visualize Boston's [Hubway](http://thehubway.com/) bike sharing system.

## Building/Running

Every dependency is part of the project either as a submodule or a component.

Still, since some Google API are used, to properly run the code you need to [setup an API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#the_google_maps_api_key) with them.
